# Fortnight Catch Up No.2 - Advanced Redux
- Period: APR/7 - 18
- Goals
  - [x] Learning more about Redux
    - [x] Listening to Udemy Redux tutorial Section 21
    - [x] Make a live file using Redux 
       
## Shayne's advice
Make an actual live web app using the concepts you learned

## Progress report 
### Overview
- Briefly summarize what Redux is and its purpose
Handy state management library for a bigger size app - keeping one source of truth among the app
### Hands-on Experience
- Describe any projects or exercises I've worked on to apply the concepts
The web app called *MySend*. I've used redux to manage the send list and total points of the climbing routes. Since I've used `FireBase` for backing up the database, I used redux-thunk to deal with asynchronous fetch calls. 
### Challenges
- Outline any difficulties learning the concept and discuss how I overcame

### New concepts
- Highlight key concepts I've learned during this period
  - thunk function : a function that delays computation
  - `redux-thunk`: Middleware that plugs into Redux and takes care of function dispatch aka a helper that lets me write async logic in Redux
    1. If I call thunk function, this returns a function
    2. I dispatch the thunk function 
    3. `redux-thunk` runs this function and paas in dispatch as an argument
    4. My thunk runs and makes fetch request, then dispatches real actions based on the result
  - Why do we use it? 
    So we can fetch, send, or delay actions - and still keep the redux store consistant
### Conclusion
- Summarize what I've achieved and how it contributes to the development
I can manage the states and actions in my app with redux and store the data with firebase. Also, I managed to understand the process of using redux-thunk for asynchronouse calls.
