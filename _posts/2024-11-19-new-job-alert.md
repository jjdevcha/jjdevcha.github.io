# Junior Software Engineer 

It was already my second day at my new work Disrupt Digital today. 
I was a bit less anxious than the first day and happy about the progress in the configuration. 

My team has 5 people including me. Team manager Shayne, Senior software engineer AK, Backend software engineer Drew, IT support Ryan, and myself - Junior Software Engineer.
Everyone is supportive and super knowledgable. I look forware to learning a lot from the team. 

## Things I need to be careful of
1. Carriage return is a must at the end of every file  
   Apparently if I don't, there can be issues when the files get compiled.
2. Don't mutate an Object - including Array - directly
   Since it can result in unexpected side effect -> rather use destruturing for Object/ Array.
3. Always work on new branch for new update
   Remebering to checkout and pull request for new branches ->  Merge into staging branch after review
