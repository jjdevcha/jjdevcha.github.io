# My first blog post in github blog

I useed to use Wordpress / HostGator to post my blog. But I'm unsubscribing HostGator from this year so I will start my blog here instead.
Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to transfer my blog posts to here. So I will have to start from 0 again. 
Therefore, I will be writing and recording my journey of studying and learning here.

My current study is React - React hooks specifically. 
I am considering studying Typescript at the same time since Nick from Sunday coding club recommended me that TS will be helpful to understand deeply about JS and React.

Anyways, 
Happy coding!
